# city-weather-forecast

This app displays the forecast for the currrent day and the next 5 days for a city which is selected by typing in the city name.

When the search button is clicked, the openweathermap API is called a total of 3 times. One to get the current forecast, one to get the 5 day forecast and one to get the UV index. The background of the UV index varies based on the number. The icon also varies based on the weather, and this is based on the API response.

The elements are stacked veritcally on a mobile screen and on a desktop screen, there is a sidebar on the left and the 5 day forecast is layed out in a row.
